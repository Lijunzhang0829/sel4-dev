# spec-strengthen survey — AInvs / IpcCancel_AI.thy — 2026-06-10

Source: `verification/l4v/proof/invariant-abstract/IpcCancel_AI.thy`

This survey follows the 4-layer model: detector outputs are collected per-pattern, then presented by **verification tier** rather than by a unified candidate ranking.

Evidence tags:
- `mechanical`: preflight already completed; candidate is high-confidence execute material
- `heuristic`: scanner hit only; execute must upgrade it with a probe
- `heuristic+manual`: scanner hit only; human review remains mandatory
- `none`: no detector; execute-only/manual path

## Tier 1 — Mechanically clean (high-confidence apply)

Pattern G candidates. These already passed direct-grep and crunch-derived preflight checks.

(none in this file)

## Out of scope / manual only

**Pattern D** has no detector. It is an execute-only path with evidence tag `none`.
```
  spec_strengthen_run.sh execute --pattern D \
    --patch <patch> --theory <thy> --expid <expid> [--key <key>] [-y]
```
